## Cooling Fan

### GPIO Based Cooling Fan
The fan was connected to GPIO 23 and 25 to allow for Analong PWM, to control the fan at different speeds depending on the temperature of the RPI
The pi is used as a home media center running OSMC and uses a 12V HiFi DAC in an enclosed box with heatsinks and a cut out to allow for proper ventilation.
Due to the nature of a media center, when it runs 1080P videos for an extended amount of time the temperature raises and begins to throttle performance, as such
this fan helps to cool the board quickly to prevent any performance throttling.
